            How I Work With Clients

            Discovery Call
            You tell me what you need. I’ll help scope it.

            Proposal & Quote
            Flat pricing with timelines. No hidden fees.

            Build & Deliver
            I build your custom app/API, and demo it for you.

            Optional Ongoing Support
            Monthly updates, hosting, or scale help—only if you want it.
